# Projects

This repo has simple code demonstrations to introduce and teach how to use PyTorch for image classification and the Gemini API for AI-powered image recognition and conversational tasks.

1. **PyTorch Demo**  
   The `pytorch` folder contains a simple image classification model that distinguishes between invoices and receipts.  

2. **Gemini API Demo**  
   The `gemini` folder provides basic examples of using the Gemini API in Python for image recognition and conversational tasks.  
   > You will need to replace the placeholder with your own API key.

# Interactive Environment
### Conda environment with environment.yml

This is an interactive environment to explore pytorch and gemini projects. For the gemini project, you will need to replace the placeholder for the API key.
